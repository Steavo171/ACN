iii) generate the first address , last address and total number of address for classless ipv4 addressing sceme
iv) calculation of custom masking value for classless ipv4 addresses



//calculation proof for cusmask to be written on blank page

eg 10.10.2.1

10.0.0.0 = network address
10 = net id
0.10.2.1 = host address
10.2.1 = host id

193.122.4.44



cidr notation

/8
/16
/24


enter subnet /18
customized value is ...
